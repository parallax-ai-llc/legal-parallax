## About This Entry

This page appears to function as a *duplicate marker* rather than a standalone biography: the body text explicitly points readers to the primary subject ("See Elon Musk"). In datasets that ingest or mirror public knowledge bases, placeholder or duplicate pages can occur due to:

- Draft or test pages created during editing workflows
- Data imports that treat redirects/placeholders as full entities
- Automated extraction that cannot reliably merge near-identical names

Because the underlying source URL may not be stable or may not exist as a canonical article, treat the details here (e.g., identifiers, timeline rows) as *non-authoritative* until verified against a primary biography.

## How to Verify and De-duplicate (Practical Checklist)

When reconciling a suspected duplicate entity, the following high-level checks are commonly used in knowledge-graph and archival workflows:

1. **Confirm canonical page/identifier**: locate the primary article (or Wikidata item) for the intended person.
2. **Compare immutable attributes**: date of birth, place of birth, and full legal name (when available) are stronger signals than occupation alone.
3. **Check for redirects and deletion logs**: duplicates may be converted into redirects or removed after editorial review.
4. **Inspect outbound references**: if the duplicate has no independent sources beyond "see main page", it is likely not a distinct entity.
5. **Record merge rationale**: note whether the merge was due to identical biographical fields, editorial guidance, or a redirect relationship.

## Data Modeling Notes

If you maintain a structured archive, a duplicate-like entry can be retained safely by modeling it as one of the following:

- **Alias/alternate label**: keep the string "Elon Musk duplicate" as an alias pointing to the canonical entity.
- **Redirect stub**: represent the record as a redirect node with a single edge to the main subject.
- **Low-confidence entity**: keep it separate but mark as `status=unverified` until manual review.

This approach preserves provenance (the fact that the duplicate label existed) without inflating person counts or introducing conflicting timelines.
