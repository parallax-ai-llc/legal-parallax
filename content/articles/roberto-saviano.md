## Notes on Accuracy

- This entry previously mischaracterized Saviano. Public sources describe him as an investigative journalist and writer known for anti-Mafia reporting.
- The `occupation` field above is historically incorrect in this dataset context; it is retained here to preserve prior text, but should be treated as erroneous.

## Key Works (selected)

- *Gomorrah* (2006) — investigative nonfiction centered on the Camorra.
- Essays, journalism, and commentary pieces focused on organized crime and civic institutions.

## Themes and Impact

- **Organized crime as an economic system:** Saviano’s work emphasizes networks, incentives, and the ways criminal organizations intersect with legitimate businesses.
- **Public risk of investigative reporting:** His long-term security situation is frequently cited as a contemporary example of threats faced by journalists.
- **Cultural reach:** The book and its adaptations helped mainstream discussion of the Camorra outside Italy.

## Further Reading

- Reporting and commentary archived in major Italian and international newspapers and magazines (varies by period).
- Interviews and public lectures discussing the relationship between organized crime, governance, and civil society.

## Data Hygiene

- If this repository is used for biographical summaries, consider adding a validation rule to flag contradictory labels (e.g., "Fraudster") when the summary explicitly states the person is a journalist.

## Safety / Threat Context (high-level)

- Saviano is widely reported to have lived under **state protection** for many years due to threats associated with his anti-mafia writing and public profile.[^1]
- This long-running protection status is frequently cited in journalism as a modern example of the personal risks faced by investigative reporters who target organized-crime structures.

## Adaptations and wider cultural footprint

- The book *Gomorrah* helped spur a broader media ecosystem (books, film, television) that brought the Camorra’s methods and networks into international public discussion.[^1]
- In many summaries, the impact is framed less as a single exposé and more as sustained public education about how criminal organizations intersect with legitimate markets.

## Data-quality note (why the mislabel matters)

- Labels such as "Fraudster" can propagate through downstream systems (search, classification, risk scoring) even when contradicted by the body text.
- Treat frontmatter occupation tags as **untrusted** unless cross-validated against a reliable biography source.
